# 🌐 AI-Driven Development — 30-Day Challenge
## 📝 Task 2 — Official Submission

## 📁 Part A — Theory (Short Questions)

### 1. Nine Pillars Understanding
**Q1:** AI Dev Agents remove repetitive setup so your focus stays on architecture, patterns, and system direction — exactly what shapes a system architect.  
**Q2:** The Nine Pillars push you across specs, automation, agents, TDD, orchestration, and versioning. With AI filling gaps, you gain multi-domain depth, forming an M-Shaped skillset.

### 2. Vibe Coding vs Spec-Driven Development
**Q1:** Vibe Coding fails because it has zero structure. After a week, the logic becomes inconsistent, undocumented, and hard to maintain.  
**Q2:** SDD fixes this by forcing clarity early — inputs, outputs, rules, constraints. The project stays organized, predictable, and scalable.

### 3. Architecture Thinking
**Q1:** Architecture-first turns a developer into a system planner who designs layers, boundaries, flows, and guides AI intelligently.  
**Q2:** Thinking in layers avoids long-term chaos. It separates concerns so the system stays clean, scalable, and easier for AI to extend.

## 📁 Part B — Practical Task

### 1️⃣ CLI Prompt
Generate a one-paragraph specification for an email validation function with these rules: must contain "@", must include a valid domain (.com, .org, .net), must return clear error messages.

### Generated Specification
The email validation function evaluates whether an input string meets the structural requirements of a valid email address. It must include exactly one “@” separating a non-empty local-part from its domain, and the domain must contain a valid TLD such as .com, .org, or .net. If any rule fails, the function must return a precise error message explaining the issue — such as missing “@” or invalid domain extension. Only when all checks pass should it return a successful validation result.

## 📁 Part C — Multiple Choice Questions

1. Purpose of Spec-Driven Development? — ✅ **B. Clear requirements before coding**  
2. Biggest mindset shift in AIDD? — ✅ **B. Thinking in systems and clear instructions**  
3. Main failure of Vibe Coding? — ✅ **B. Architecture becomes hard to extend**  
4. Key advantage of AI CLI agents? — ✅ **B. Handle repetitive tasks so dev focuses on design & problem-solving**

## 🌟 Reflection
This task highlights how development is shifting toward system-level thinking. Instead of manually writing everything, developers now design structures, orchestrate agents, and think in workflows. With SDD, AI CLIs, and the Nine Pillars, you get clarity, scalability, and multi-domain depth — the foundation of an M-Shaped professional in the AI-native era.
