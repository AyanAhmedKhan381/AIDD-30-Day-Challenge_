# 🚀 Overview
This project showcases how I successfully connected the **Hosted GitHub MCP Server** with the **Google Gemini CLI**. After the integration, Gemini can interact with my GitHub repositories, list files, check metadata, and use 90+ MCP tools — all without Docker or any local MCP setup. This is the simplest, fastest way to give your AI access to GitHub.

# ✨ What This Project Includes
✔ Secure `.env` token handling  
✔ Fully configured `settings.json` for MCP  
✔ Gemini connected to GitHub MCP Server  
✔ Verification using `mcp list`  
✔ AI successfully reading GitHub repositories

# 🔐 1. Secure Token Setup (.env)
Create a `.env` file:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

⚠ Make sure not to expose this token publicly.  
⚠ Blur it in your screenshots.

# ⚙️ 2. MCP Configuration (settings.json)
This is the exact configuration used to connect Gemini with GitHub MCP:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "server": "mcp+https://mcp-github.fly.dev",
      "credentials": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": {
          "type": "env",
          "env": "GITHUB_TOKEN"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

✔ No installation needed  
✔ Token auto-loaded  
✔ Remote MCP server (hosted)  

---

# 🔄 3. Restart Gemini CLI
Close the terminal → open Gemini again.  
The MCP server loads automatically.

---

# 🟢 4. Connection Verification
Run:

```
mcp list
```

Expected Output:

```
🟢 github — Ready (90+ tools)
```

🎉 This confirms your GitHub MCP connection is successful.

---

# 🧪 5. Test the AI Connection
Ask Gemini:

```
List my GitHub repositories
```

If it shows your repo list → 🎯 **Integration Complete**

---

# 🛠️ AI Capabilities After Integration
After successful MCP connection, Gemini can:

📂 List repositories  
📄 Read files  
🧭 Navigate directories  
📝 View commits & branches  
🧰 Use 90+ GitHub automation tools  
🤖 Act like a GitHub assistant
