# 🔹 What is SPECKit Plus?

Spec Kit is a framework where you build software by writing **clear specifications first** instead of jumping straight into coding.
You describe exactly *what the app should do*, and Spec Kit uses that to create **plans, tasks, and even help generate code** with AI tools.
Basically, AI tools assist in executing the framework's commands accurately.

## Writing short answers of the core concepts of SPECKit Plus 🎨:

### 1. 📜 Constitution Phase (●'◡'●)

Defines the **purpose, goals, scope, and problem statement** of the project.
This phase sets the foundation and explains **why the project exists**.

### 2. ✏ Specify Phase (❁´◡`❁)

Turns the idea into **clear, precise requirements and behaviors** so the system and AI tools know exactly what must be built.

### 3. 🧠 Plan Phase ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ

Converts the specifications into a **practical build strategy**—deciding what to do first, how to do it, and in what order.

### 4. 📝 Tasks Phase (⌐■_■)

Breaks the plan into **small, actionable tasks** that are easy to track, execute, and verify.

### 5. ⚙ Implement Phase (⊙_⊙;)

Carries out the tasks through **coding, testing, and deployment**, producing the final working solution.
